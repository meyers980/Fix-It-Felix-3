## Controls
MAME style controls, can be customized in settings.ini. Requires 4-way joystick, two action buttons, and 2 start buttons

## Gameplay
Fix It Felix is doing his best to stop ralph from destroying another building - this time using ropes and a window-washing cart to move around. 

## Cabinet
This game was designed as a drop-in for any Fix It Felix style cabinet. Vertical monitor is recommended but not necessary. 

## Compile
This game is made with Gamemaker Studio 2. The project needs to be opened and compiled from within. Tested for both Windows and HTML IDE, but I would think it should also work on Mac. Releases includes Windows executible binaries.
