Controls: You can change controls in settings.ini. To change, find the UTF-8 value for the key you'd like to use (if it's in hex, convert it to decimal). This page shows the decimal values for many keyboard keys (capital letters). https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/game%20assets/fonts/font_tables.html
Or here (remember to convert the hex value to decimal): https://docs2.yoyogames.com/index.html?page=source%2F_build%2F3_scripting%2F4_gml_reference%2Findex.html

Resolution: You can manually set the game's resolution in settings.ini. It was designed to run at the original arcade vertical resolution of 224x256 but also looks fine at 2x (448x512) or custom resolutions. Game will keep aspect ratio. If you enable fullscreen, resolution will be ignored and instead run at computer's fullscreen mode.

Game Title: The game title can be changed from Fix It Felix 3 to Wreck It Ralph 3 for your cabinet's preference. Set true or false in settings.ini
